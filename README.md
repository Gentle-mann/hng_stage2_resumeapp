ResumeApp
 
App Description
This is a resume app which shows information about me. It has my name, picture, contact information
and my social media links.

Code Base Description
The app is built using the Flutter framework and Dart. It consist of four pages: The About Me, Contact Info, Social Media and Settings page.\
The list of pages is displayed in a drawer.

Design Description
The app has a very simple design. Majority of the design was done using Flutter layout widgets.
Only the About Me page has a CustomScrollView with slivers. I did not use any external designs.

External Libraries
The only external library I used is plugin: url_launcher. I used it to insert the web links to my social media pages.

Features I Would Like to Add
1. Dark theme implementation
2. Making the app get all data from the user, without relying on hard-coded values.
3. Registering users using FirebaseAuth and saving user data using FirebaseFirestore.

Challenges I Faced
The first challenge I faced came immediately I finished reading the task instructions. I was overcome with doubt and the thought the I was not good enough
to do a good job. I was able to overcome that by just changing my mindset from desperately hanging on and wanting to move to the next stage of the internship,
to a more positive mindset, i.e, just trying my best to finish the task without worrying too much about whether I pass or fail.

I have not build a resume app before. So, at first, I did not have any idea how to even begin. But I calmed myself and check online for inspiration.
The rest was just smooth-sailing to be honest.
